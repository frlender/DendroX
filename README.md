# DendroX

Multi-level multi-cluster selections in a dendrogram

## Introduction

 Cluster heatmaps are widely used in cheminformatics and other fields to uncover clustering patterns in data matrices. Most cluster heatmap packages provide utility functions to divide the dendrograms at a certain level to obtain clusters, but it is often difficult to identify the most appropriate cut in the dendrogram to obtain the clusters seen in the heatmap. Multiple cuts are required if clusters locate at different levels in the dendrogram. To address this issue, we developed DendroX, a web app that provides interactive visualization of a dendrogram where users can divide the dendrogram at any level and in any number of clusters and pass the labels of the divided clusters for functional analysis.
