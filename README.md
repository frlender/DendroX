# DendroX

Multi-level multi-cluster selections in a dendrogram

## Introduction

 Cluster heatmaps are widely used in biology and other fields to uncover clustering patterns in data matrices. Most cluster heatmap packages provide utility functions to divide the dendrograms at a certain level to obtain clusters, but it is often difficult to identify the most appropriate cut in the dendrogram to obtain the clusters seen in the heatmap. To address this issue, we developed DendroX, a web app that provides interactive visualization of a dendrogram in which users can divide the dendrogram at any level and into any number of clusters. The labels of the divided clusters can be passed on for downstream functional analysis. Although there are several online tools to generate cluster heatmaps, these tools mostly duplicate the functions provided by existing packages and do not have the cluster-selection feature as DendroX does. We believe the proposed app fills a gap in the cluster-analysis workflow and improves the efficiency of using a cluster heatmap.
